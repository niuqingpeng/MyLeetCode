/*

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. 
A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:

00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

Note: 
Given n=3, the gray code sequence is:
000
001
011
010
110
111
101
100
Thus, the sequence of n=k, say S(k) is S(k-1)+ reverse of S(k-1) with 1 on highest bit
